# DSA
My personal library of Data Structures, Algorithms, and problem-solving patterns.
About This Repository
Welcome to my DSA repository!
This project is a curated collection of fundamental data structures and efficient algorithms designed to sharpen problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews at top-tier companies.


To document my journey in mastering algorithmic thinking.

To provide clean, well-commented code for common patterns like Sliding Window, Two Pointers, and Dynamic Programming.

To act as a quick reference for Big O time and space complexities.
