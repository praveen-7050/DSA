searching algorthim means finding the Elements or index value of the element trough searching the array ar list 
there are two types of searching they are
---linear search
---binary search
    linear search means searching the array or list from start linearly if we want to find the value it iterates tgroung until the element to be find if the element not find it return 1 if the element is finded first it is o(1) if the element is find at the middle it is an average case it is o(n) and last also o(n) bascially it is used for small type of an array and unsorted array  if its is array is  big its took time not preferable so we go to binary search 

linear search time complexity 
    best case o(1)--first to before middle
    average case o(n) -- average element ,middle 
    worst case o(n)--last element ,not found 
space complexity of an linear search 
    o(1) constnt
