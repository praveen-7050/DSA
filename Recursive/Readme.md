Recursive function is calling the function itself to slove the program by breaking into small subproblems until the base case is reached
<!-- ----------------------------------------------- -->
Base case → stops the recursion
Recursive case → function calls itself
Time compelxity - o(n) time comlexity per call is o(1)
